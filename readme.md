My crack at Wes Bos' Javascript course 30JS - recently became interested in expanding my vanilla JS capabilities after finding some extremely useful in a React project I had going. Best way to learn is by building things and these projects are small and self-contained enough not to interrupt my larger projects.

I have elected to try the "puzzles" without watching any videos beyond the point at which Wes sets up the project. 

I believe that researching Mozilla's docs will offer a deeper and more longlasting learning experience than watching someone else build it and typing along.

Long term: Once I have finished the project, I'd like to redo all the solutions in Typescript as a learning exercise for typed JS.
