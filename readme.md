My crack at Wes Boss' Javascript course 30JS - recently became interested in vanilla JS after using some in a React project I had going. Best way to learn is by making stuff and these projects are small and self-contained enough not to interrupt my broader workflow.

I have elected to try the "puzzles" ONLY. I haven't watched any videos beyond the point at which Wes sets up the project. I believe that researching Mozilla's docs will offer a deeper and more longlasting learning experience than watching Wes build it.

Long term: Once I have finished the project, I'd like to redo all the solutions in Typescript as a learning exercise for typed JS.
